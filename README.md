# ZZZ

Base skeleton for a full-stack app:

- Backend: Django + Django REST Framework
- Frontend: React + Vite + Tailwind CSS + DaisyUI

This repository has been reset to a minimal starter layout. Use the folders `backend/` and `frontend/` to begin development.

Quick start (developer):

Backend (Python & Django):

1. Create a Python virtual environment and activate it.
2. cd backend
3. pip install -r requirements.txt
4. python manage.py migrate
5. python manage.py runserver

Frontend (Node & Vite):

1. cd frontend
2. npm install
3. npm run dev

Notes:
- This is a minimal scaffold. Update SECRET_KEY, environment variables and production settings before deploying.
